This folder contains scripts that can be used to load both RC-built and
Spack-built modules.  Here is how to install them:

compilers.yaml: Create the following folder:
   mkdir -p ~/.spack/linux
   cp compilers.yaml ~/.spack/linux/compilers.yaml

init.gc-classic.*centos7 files:
   mkdir ~/init
   cp init*centos7 ~/init
