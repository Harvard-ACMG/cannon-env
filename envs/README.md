# cannon-env/envs: Environment files for Cannon

**Environment files** contain the commands to load software modules (e.g. compiler, netCDF, MPI) that you will need to run GEOS-Chem or GCHP.

When you run the `copy-cannon-env` script, these files will be copied to your `$HOME/envs` folder on Cannon.  You can copy or link these to a more convenient location (such as your home directory).
