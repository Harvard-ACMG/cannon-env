Directory Listing:
===============================================================================

root            -- copy these files to your root-level directory ( ~ )

                       first time you log into a machine. 

root/.bashrc_OD     -- bash environment file for Odyssey. Once copied to your
                       root directory and renamed .bashrc, this file is executed 
                       every time you start a new shell on a machine.

bin/startup          -- File that you use at login time to pop open several 
                        X-windows on various machines. It also starts an emacs 
                        session. You change the machines for which windows
                        will be opened. You may also comment out the section
                        that opens the emacs editor if you do not prefer to use
                        emacs.

File Listing for Bash Directory:

                       *NOTE: Only copy this file on Odyssey.

File Listing for .ssh Directory:
===============================================================================

.ssh/config         -- File to store your Odyssey username and hostname to 
                       enable one-time connection setup to Odyssey from AS.
                       This allows copying files between Odyssey and AS without
                       entering your Odyssey password and verification code 
                       every time. 
                       *NOTE: Only copy this file on AS. Edit 'USERNAME' to be

File Listing for IDL Directory:
===============================================================================

IDL/idl_startup.pro -- IDL startup settings.
 

File Listing for Doc Directory:
===============================================================================

doc/Makefile	    -- Makefile to create the reference document for the env
                       in *.pdf and *.ps formats.

doc/intro.txt       -- Header file for creating *.pdf and *.ps reference 
                       documents

     
Making the Reference Documentation:
===============================================================================

The system environment files (all except .emacs and .xemacs-options) use the 
ProTeX automatic documentation system.  This enables you to create reference 
documents in *.pdf and *.ps format from the comments in the subroutine headers.

To build the reference documents, type:

   make doc

This will create the following documents in the doc/ subdirectory:

   SystemEnvFiles.pdf               
   SystemEnvFiles.ps
   SystemEnvFiles.tex
	-- Reference document for the system environment files
           in *.pdf, *.ps, and LaTeX formats


If you wish to remove the reference documentation files, type:

   make clean


That's it.  Good luck and contact me if you have any questions!
