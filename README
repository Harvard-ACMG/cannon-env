doc/intro.txt              ; Header file for creating *.pdf and *.ps reference 
                             documents

     
Making the Reference Documentation:
===============================================================================

The system environment files (all except .emacs and .xemacs-options) use the 
ProTeX automatic documentation system.  This enables you to create reference 
documents in *.pdf and *.ps format from the comments in the subroutine headers.

To build the reference documents, type:

   make doc

This will create the following documents in the doc/ subdirectory:

   SystemEnvFiles.pdf               
   SystemEnvFiles.ps
   SystemEnvFiles.tex
	-- Reference document for the system environment files
           in *.pdf, *.ps, and LaTeX formats


If you wish to remove the reference documentation files, type:

   make clean


That's it.  Good luck and contact me if you have any questions!
