File Listing:
===============================================================================

.cshrc          -- tcsh environment file.  This file is executed every time 
                   you start a new shell on a machine.  Copy this to your home 
                   directory.

.login          -- Login file.  This file is only executed the first time you
                   log into a machine.  Copy this to your home directory (~).

.emacs          -- Customization file for Emacs.  This file contains 
                   customization commands for emacs on Tethys, Rhea, and 
                   Gateway, and the older xemacs on Hera, Europa, Sol.  
                   NOTE: Some of the older Xemacs functions may not work, 
                   we recommend using Emacs from now on.  Copy this to your 
                   home directory (~).

.soft           -- Customization file for the SoftEnv program.  This allows
                   you to set which versions of installed software programs
                   to use.
\
.Xdefaults      -- Sets specific setting (colors, window sizes, etc.) for
                   X11 applications (such as xterm).

startup         -- File that you use at login time to pop open several 
                   X-windows on various machines.  It also starts an emacs 
                   session.  You change the machines for which windows
                   will be opened.  You may also comment out the section
                   that opens the emacs editor if you do not prefer to use
                   emacs.  Copy this to your ~/bin directory.

xt              -- Perl script which opens an Xwindow and performs an ssh
                   command.  This script is used by "startup.  You can edit
                   the font sizes and window colors manually.  Copy this
                   to your ~/bin directory.

Makefile	-- Makefile to create the reference document in *.pdf
                   and *.ps formats.

intro.txt       -- Header file for creating *.pdf and *.ps reference documents

              
     
Making the Reference Documentation:
===============================================================================

The system environment files (all except .emacs and .xemacs-options) use the 
ProTeX automatic documentation system.  This enables you to create reference 
documents in *.pdf and *.ps format from the comments in the subroutine headers.

To build the reference documents, type:

   make doc

This will create the following documents in the doc/ subdirectory:

   SystemEnvFiles.pdf               
   SystemEnvFiles.ps
   SystemEnvFiles.tex
	-- Reference document for the system environment files
           in *.pdf, *.ps, and LaTeX formats


If you wish to remove the reference documentation files, type:

   make clean


That's it.  Good luck and contact me if you have any questions!
